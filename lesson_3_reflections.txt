When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When the amount of local work is too big to store or you need to work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling changes manually forces you to keep track of all of the differences
If you pull automatically you may miss others' contributions.
